								<h2>WHY I DO WHAT I DO</h2>
								<hr class="title-underline">
								<p>My name is Seojin Lee and currently, I am a second year mechanical engineering student at McMaster University. I've always felt fortunate that I know what it wanted to do. I've always had this love for engineering. I've always loved to take things apart, learn how it works, (try to) make it better. As a kid, I was never satisfied of how things were meant to be used and when I became old enough to understand that not every product can meet my specific needs, rather than settling with the inconvenience, I tried to make it so that it did (although it </strike>didn't always</strike> almost never worked out). That's what I love about engineering. Being able to create something that I specifically design, even if I don't end up using my creation at all, that sense of speciality still excites me. However I don't think this is only exclusive to engineering. Like everyone else, I've gone through lots of hobbies. However programming has been the only one that gives me that same excitement. The internet has been a part of my life ever since I can remember, and just like any other physical product I've used, I face the same problem: not all websites can meet my specific need. I don't believe that web development is separate from engineering. I believe that my engineering mind is pulling me towards this field and my problem solving skills and creativity is what's allowing me to keep interested and making me want to learn more. I don't think web development is just another hobby to me. I am pursuing engineering as my future, however I believe web development will stay close to me.</p>
